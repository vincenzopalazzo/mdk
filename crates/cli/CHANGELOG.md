# Changelog

All notable changes to `wn-cli` (previously `darkmatter-cli`) are tracked here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This crate uses semantic
versioning through the workspace version in the root `Cargo.toml`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- MarmotKit/UniFFI now exposes encrypted per-account composer draft storage with metadata-only list, full load, upsert,
  and delete operations. Drafts retain their text, reply target, ordered attachment bytes, and attachment presentation
  metadata in the account's SQLCipher database; attachment bytes are loaded only for the selected draft.
- MarmotKit/UniFFI now exposes the cached Nostr Kind 0 `website` field through a read-only profile accessor so app
  profile surfaces can display it without widening the writable profile record.

### Fixed

- Encrypted media and encrypted group-image uploads now default to an ordered list of Blossom endpoints that accept
  opaque `application/octet-stream` ciphertext instead of the media-only Primal endpoint that returned HTTP 415.
  Blossom upload failures also retain bounded, privacy-filtered server rejection reasons for actionable diagnostics.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Added host-provided external signer account support for app integrations whose Nostr private key stays outside MDK.
  UniFFI can now register/login external signer accounts, account summaries expose whether signing is local or
  external, and runtime signing paths cover media upload auth, push/gift-wrap publishing, relay auth, directory
  publishing, and account identity proofs.
- UniFFI now exposes encrypted Blossom group avatars to host apps through `AppGroupRecordFfi.image_hash_hex` and
  `download_group_blossom_image`, allowing clients to detect, cache, fetch, verify, and decrypt encrypted group avatar
  images.
- Added production-shaped `wn-opencode` release packaging alongside `wn-agent`: versioned harness binaries, the
  `install-opencode-marmot.sh` installer, service setup paths, deterministic installer tests, and connector E2E
  coverage.
- Added SafeAAD app-component support advertisement so engine leaves declare support for the SafeAAD component and reject
  attempts to override it as caller-supplied group component data.

### Changed

- Account identity proofs now use a v2 canonical unpublished Nostr event signature, making account setup compatible
  with platform signers that can sign Nostr events but do not expose raw digest signing.
- WN Agent non-draft releases refresh `wn-agent-latest` installer aliases for Hermes, OpenClaw, and OpenCode while
  keeping versioned release assets pinned to their immutable `wn-agent-v<version>` release.
- Release metadata now uses standardized titles across the MDK, WN Agent, and MarmotKit tracks, and the new
  `just release-all <version>` coordinator cuts the whole cohort from one checked `origin/master` commit.

### Fixed

- Android MarmotKit binding generation now keeps the host UniFFI dylib unstripped and fails loudly if Kotlin output is
  missing, avoiding empty binding bundles when release builds set `RUSTFLAGS="-C strip=symbols"`.
- External signer account setup now discovers existing account profiles before setup and keeps account discovery
  relay-scoped.
- Push owner proof verification accepts the new event-based proof while retaining legacy verification fallback for
  already-published owner proofs.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Workspace version unified at `0.9.0` across all crates (successor to MDK `0.8.0`).
- Documentation refresh: current-state inventory, missing crate READMEs, agent integration agent maps, and release
  doc alignment.
- The TUI now supports `/image <file-path> [caption]` by calling the real encrypted `wn media upload --send` path for
  the selected chat instead of rejecting image sends or inventing a plaintext placeholder.
- `wn groups invites`, `wn groups accept <group>`, and `wn groups decline <group>` now use the app runtime's
  pending-invite state and accept/decline paths instead of returning `unsupported_command`.
- `wn notifications subscribe` is now visible in help and streams daemon-backed local notification updates instead of
  returning `unsupported_command`.
- `wn keys list` now returns KeyPackage event ids and local/relay origin, and `wn keys delete` / `wn keys delete-all
  --confirm` publish real Nostr deletion events through the app runtime.
- The daemon-backed `wn stream compose-open`, `compose-append`, `compose-finish`, and `compose-cancel` commands are now
  visible in help and return a daemon-required error instead of `unsupported_command` when `wnd` is unavailable.
- `wn chats mute <group> <duration>`, `wn chats unmute <group>`, `/chat mute`, and `/chat unmute` now manage real
  per-chat local notification suppression instead of hiding or rejecting that surface.
- `wn sync` is visible in top-level help as the CLI diagnostic/repair catch-up path. The TUI still rejects `/sync`
  because live updates come from daemon subscriptions.
- `export-nsec`, relay type validation, and confirmation-gated destructive commands now return specific JSON error
  codes instead of sharing a generic unsupported-command shape.
- `wn-agent` stream finalization now accepts idempotency keys, and the OpenClaw/Hermes adapters retry
  `stream_finalize` with stable per-stream keys so a post-write timeout does not duplicate the durable final.
- Hermes dev setup now mirrors OpenClaw by passing custom QUIC preview candidates through the generated
  `bootstrap-agent.sh` helper and syntax-checking every generated helper script in its contract test.
- WN Agent release assets now include Hermes and OpenClaw one-line installers that perform guided full setup for
  `wn-agent`, gateway plugin config, and same-user service startup while preserving existing gateway connectors/channels.
- The Hermes and OpenClaw installers now use connector-specific default homes, service names, and bootstrap labels so
  default installs create separate Marmot/Nostr agent identities on the same machine.
- WN Agent release assets now include the `wn-opencode` Marmot harness and `install-opencode-marmot.sh`, providing a
  service-backed setup path for machines that already have OpenCode installed.
- The OpenCode installer uses the terminal-harness agent home (`~/.marmot-agents/harnesses`) and connector-specific
  `wn-agent` service identity by default, leaving room for future terminal harness backends to share that agent.
- Non-draft WN Agent releases now refresh a `wn-agent-latest` installer-only release so curl setup commands can default
  to the latest connector/harness installers while versioned releases remain available for pinned installs.

### Security

- Every outbound relay connection now passes through one host-safety chokepoint: relay endpoints whose literal host is
  loopback, RFC1918/private, link-local (including `169.254.169.254`), CGNAT, multicast, or IPv6 ULA are rejected before
  a socket is opened, so a poisoned routing record or relay-list event can no longer steer the relay pool at internal
  services (SSRF). Local relays (e.g. an in-process `MockRelay` or a dev `nostr-rs-relay`) are reachable only when
  `WN_ALLOW_LOOPBACK_RELAYS=1` is set, mirroring `WN_ALLOW_LOOPBACK_BLOB_ENDPOINTS`; production installs leave it unset.
- The `wn-agent` connector no longer connects to an agent-supplied `quic://` broker candidate that resolves to a
  non-public address, and no longer derives no-cert-verification (`insecure_local`) trust from a candidate that merely
  resolves to loopback. Loopback brokers are reachable, without certificate verification, only when `wn-agent serve` is
  started with the new `--insecure-local-broker` dev flag and the candidate host is a literal loopback (SSRF + trust
  downgrade hardening).
- The `wnd` daemon control socket (and the `wn-agent` connector socket) is now created owner-only (0600)
  atomically — bound inside a private 0700 staging directory and linked into place — instead of being chmod-ed
  after `bind`, removing the brief window where the socket was reachable at umask-default permissions (for
  example under a caller-supplied `--socket` in a pre-existing shared directory).
- Daemon auto-watch of inbound agent stream starts (kind:1200) no longer derives no-cert-verification
  (`insecure_local`) trust from the sender-controlled `quic://` candidate, and QUIC candidate resolution now rejects
  sender-provided candidates that resolve to loopback, RFC1918/private, link-local (including `169.254.169.254`),
  multicast, unspecified, broadcast, IPv6 unique-local (ULA), or IPv6 unicast link-local endpoints. Local endpoints are
  only reachable when the local user explicitly passes `--insecure-local` (SSRF + trust downgrade hardening).
- The direct and broker QUIC preview transports now share one hardening profile: the `marmot-quic-broker` no longer
  enables replayable TLS 0-RTT early data (an off-path attacker could replay captured publish control frames to
  create/feed rooms); every preview dial (`wn stream send/watch`, broker publish/subscribe) is bounded by a 15 s
  connect timeout and a client-side idle/keepalive transport config; `wn stream receive` bounds its wait for a sender
  to dial (300 s) and the TLS handshake; broker control frames are capped at 256 bytes pre-auth (previously a peer
  could demand a ~66 KB allocation per stream before validation); and broker frame reads apply one deadline across the
  whole frame, so a peer dribbling one byte per timeout window can no longer stretch pre-auth reads.
- Group creation now enforces the same admin-policy invariants every commit already enforces. A group can no longer be
  created listing an admin who is not one of the initial members (a "phantom" admin that would silently gain admin
  rights the moment a matching member joined, with no admin-grant event anyone observes), and admin identities are
  validated as real secp256k1 keys rather than accepted on length alone. The engine-owned profile and admin-policy
  components are also non-negotiable: an invitee whose KeyPackage omits them is rejected up front instead of the group
  being created with an empty admin set that permanently freezes all membership changes. Welcome-join applies the same
  admin-leaf check before accepting a group.
- A single group member can no longer permanently disable another member's ability to send by broadcasting one crafted
  far-future-epoch message. The convergence send-gate now bounds the future side of the horizon the same way it already
  bounds the past: a buffered convergence input more than `max_rewind_commits` epochs ahead of the group tip (which can
  never chain from the tip) no longer counts as unresolved work, and a convergence row that fails to decode/project now
  fails open instead of closed. Previously such an input left the group reporting "unsettled" forever, so every outbound
  send was queued and never drained, with no recovery short of manual database surgery.

### Fixed

- `wnd` now buffers daemon request frames before scanning for the newline delimiter, avoiding one async `read()` call per
  byte for large `Execute` requests while preserving the existing 1 MiB request cap and stalled-client timeout.
- A legitimate long agent preview (more than 4096 records or 1 MiB of cumulative deltas) is no longer silently
  terminated mid-stream by the QUIC broker: the broker's publish path previously enforced the subscriber-sized receive
  defaults on the publisher and closed the room when they tripped. Forward-role limits now come from broker
  configuration (see the new `--publish-max-records` / `--publish-max-frame-bytes` flags) with defaults far above
  the receive defaults; subscribers still enforce their own receive limits. The byte bound counts record frame bytes
  as forwarded on the wire (ciphertext, including the per-record AEAD tag, for encrypted previews) since the broker
  never decrypts.
- A single non-UTF-8 frame on a text-bearing preview record no longer tears down the whole received preview (direct
  receive and broker subscribe): the frame renders as replacement characters and the stream continues. Transcript
  hashing covers the raw bytes, so sender/receiver transcript verification is unaffected.
- A subscriber joining a broker room with a large retained backlog no longer copies the backlog while holding the
  broker-wide lock (records are now reference-shared), so one subscribe cannot head-of-line-block publish/forward
  across every other room.
- A group copy that realized your own removal no longer stays self-quarantined when the removing commit later loses
  branch selection: the convergence apply clears the removed marker whenever the selected canonical branch records your
  membership, so `message send` works again on that group instead of failing `invalid_transition` ("local group copy is
  marked removed"). The removal's system rows are withdrawn through the existing invalidation event; rejoining via a new
  Welcome is only required while the removal remains canonical.

### Changed

- `marmot-quic-broker` gained `--publish-max-records` (default 65536) and `--publish-max-frame-bytes` (default
  64 MiB) flags bounding what the broker forwards per publish stream (frame bytes counted as carried on the wire);
  both appear in the startup output. The broker's
  publish path also now applies the same generous 120 s quiet-gap deadline to record reads that the direct path and
  the subscriber loop already used, so an alive-but-wedged publisher (kept alive by QUIC keepalives) can no longer pin
  a room indefinitely; agents quiet for under two minutes between records are unaffected.

- **Breaking:** retired the experimental "darkmatter" naming. The crate is now `wn-cli` and installs the `wn` CLI and
  `wnd` daemon; the connector daemon is `wn-agent`. Env vars moved from `DM_*` to `WN_*` (`WN_ACCOUNT`, `WN_RELAY`,
  `WN_SOCKET`, `WN_SECRET_STORE`, `WN_HOME`, `WN_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE`, `WN_ALLOW_LOOPBACK_BLOB_ENDPOINTS`,
  `WN_DEV_SETTLEMENT_QUIESCENCE_MS`), the default data directory moved from `darkmatter` to `whitenoise` (dev fallback
  `.whitenoise`), the default keychain service is `com.marmot.whitenoise`, daemon sockets are `wnd.sock` /
  `wn-agent.sock`, the profile deep-link scheme is `marmot://`, release tags follow `wn-agent-v*`, and the Homebrew
  formula is `marmot-protocol/tap/wn`. There is no automatic compatibility fallback: stop any still-running legacy
  daemon **before** the first `wnd` start (`dm daemon stop` with the old binary, or kill the pid recorded in the old
  data directory's `dev/dmd.pid`) — the renamed socket/pid files make an old `dmd` invisible to `wn daemon status`.
  Then move the data directory (for example
  `mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/darkmatter ~/Library/Application\ Support/whitenoise`), update `DM_*` env vars in
  shell profiles and service units, and reinstall from the new formula. If the data directory is not moved, `wn` starts
  with an empty account list rather than a targeted error. Keychain entries stored under the old
  `com.marmot.darkmatter` service can still be read manually by setting `WN_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE=com.marmot.darkmatter`, or
  re-import the account to write them under the new service.

- `message send` (and every other group send) on a group whose local copy records your own removal now fails with the
  deterministic JSON error code `invalid_transition` ("local group copy is marked removed (self-evicted)") instead of an
  opaque `engine_error`, matching the engine's realized self-eviction semantics (#376).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added the `dm-agent` local connector daemon with `serve` and `bootstrap --qr`, bridging Marmot encrypted groups to
  agent gateways through the `marmot.agent-control.v1` Unix-socket NDJSON protocol.
- Added the Hermes Marmot platform plugin (`integrations/hermes/marmot`) and `install-hermes-marmot.sh` for downloading
  versioned `dm-agent` binaries plus the plugin from `dm-agent-v*` GitHub Releases.
- Added the OpenClaw Marmot channel plugin (`integrations/openclaw/marmot`) and `install-openclaw-marmot.sh` for the
  same release cohort; supports durable sends, live QUIC preview streaming, inbound media, reactions, deletes, ambient
  messages, and NIP-27 mention routing through OpenClaw agent tools.
- Added a versioned DM Agent release track (`dm-agent-v<version>`) publishing `dm-agent` for linux-x86_64,
  linux-aarch64, darwin-aarch64, and darwin-x86_64, Hermes and OpenClaw plugin bundles, and pinned installer scripts.
- UniFFI: added `reveal_nsec` to export the selected account private key as `nsec1` bech32 for in-app key backup.
- UniFFI: added NIP-49 encrypted private-key export for password-wrapped backup.
- UniFFI: added per-account `unread_count` without loading a full app session.
- UniFFI: added `retry_group_convergence` for non-duplicating group repair resends.
- Added app-side per-group recovery for hydration-quarantined groups.
- Added engine `sign_out_and_wipe` for full local and remote account teardown, and non-destructive `sign_out` with
  optional relay KeyPackage cleanup.
- Added rich reaction notifications scoped to the reacted-to message author.

- Added `--data-dir` to `dm daemon start` (an alias for `--home`), completing `wnd`/`dmd` setup-flag parity
  alongside the existing `--logs-dir`, `--discovery-relays`, and `--default-account-relays`. The resolved home is
  forwarded to the spawned `dmd` child as before; `--home` still takes precedence when both are given.

- Added `dm groups set-avatar-url <group> --url <https-url> [--dim WxH] [--thumbhash <hex>]` (and `--clear`) to set,
  update, and clear the group URL avatar (`marmot.group.avatar-url.v1`) over the existing app runtime path; a parallel
  legacy `dm group set-avatar-url` form is also available. `dm groups show` / `dm chats show` now surface the
  `avatar_url` component in both human and `--json` output, and an invalid (non-HTTPS / disallowed-host) URL returns
  the stable `invalid_group_avatar_url` JSON error. `set-avatar-url` now requires exactly one of `--url` / `--clear`
  (`--dim` / `--thumbhash` only accompany `--url`), and an explicit empty `--url ""` is rejected as
  `invalid_group_avatar_url` rather than silently clearing the avatar. Human `show` output also surfaces
  `avatar_dim` / `avatar_thumbhash` render hints when present.

- The TUI now renders kind-1210 group system rows as friendly lines (e.g. "alice added bob", "bob left",
  "alice renamed the group") instead of raw JSON. These durable rows are synthesized locally from authenticated group
  state changes (member added/removed/left, admin granted/revoked, group renamed, avatar changed) and appear inline in
  message and timeline history.

- Added `dm relay-stats`, which prints the device-local relay performance telemetry (aggregate lifecycle counters,
  cross-relay arrival spread, per-relay first-deliverer and first-event/EOSE timing, and redacted relay health). The
  command runs against the live `dmd` runtime when a daemon socket exists. Output is aggregate-only and uses opaque
  device-local relay indices — never relay URLs.
- Added Whitenoise-shaped identity and plural command entrypoints: `dm create-identity`, `dm login`, `dm whoami`,
  `dm accounts`, and `dm groups`.
- Added the remaining Whitenoise-shaped top-level command names (`debug`, `logout`, `export-nsec`, `media`,
  `follows`, `profile`, `relays`, `settings`, `users`, `notifications`, and `reset`) with real local behavior where
  the app runtime supports it and explicit `unsupported_command` errors where lower-layer behavior does not exist yet.
- Added `dm chats subscribe`, `dm chats subscribe-archived`, and `dm groups subscribe-state`, which stream typed
  daemon responses for chat rows and group state.
- Added `dm messages search` and `dm messages search-all` over local projected message history.
- Added Whitenoise-shaped cursor flags for `dm messages list`: `--before`, `--before-message-id`, `--after`, and
  `--after-message-id`.
- Added real `dm groups leave` support over the Marmot SelfRemove path, including app-runtime SelfRemove capability
  advertisement.
- Added real `dm groups promote`, `dm groups demote`, and `dm groups self-demote` support over the Marmot admin-policy
  app component.
- Added typed app-message payloads for `dm messages react`, `dm messages unreact`, `dm messages delete`, and
  `dm messages retry` group-convergence retries. Message projections and `messages subscribe` now expose typed
  `app_message` metadata for reactions, deletions, and media references.
- Added `dm media list <group>`, which lists typed media references already projected from group message history.
- Added `dm media upload` and `dm media download` over `encrypted-media-v1` media and Blossom, using
  `https://blossom.primal.net` as the default upload server.
- Added `dm messages subscribe <group>`, a daemon-backed newline-delimited stream that emits typed `message`,
  `agent_stream_start`, `agent_stream_final`, `agent_stream_delta`, and `stream_preview` updates, including live
  brokered QUIC text chunks from runtime-owned stream watch state.
- Added `dm stream watch --background`, which starts a brokered QUIC stream watch through `dmd` and reports
  runtime-managed running/completed/failed preview state through `dm daemon status --json`.
- Added redacted relay-plane health to `dm daemon status --json`.
- Added `dmd --default-account-relays`, matching `wnd` setup flags and applying daemon account-relay defaults to
  daemon-forwarded account creation.
- Added TUI `/stream` slash commands for starting, watching, finishing, verifying, and inspecting brokered agent text
  stream previews from the selected chat.
- Added a TUI status panel below the composer with the latest status line, selected-chat MLS epoch/group/member state,
  and raw app-component data from `dm groups show --json`.
- Added `dm stream start`, `dm stream finish`, and `dm stream verify` for anchoring agent text
  stream starts/finals through normal encrypted Marmot messages and checking QUIC transcript hashes.
- Added `dm stream watch` and `dm stream send --broker` for brokered QUIC preview streams anchored by the
  durable start message.
- Added `dm stream receive` and `dm stream send` for provisional raw QUIC agent text stream previews.
- Added `dm keys rotate` as an explicit repair command that force-mints and publishes a fresh replacement KeyPackage.
- Added TUI unread badges for chats that receive messages while another chat is selected.
- Added a TUI slash-command suggestion popup that opens on `/` and filters as the composer input narrows.
- Added a scrollable TUI messages panel: Tab to the Messages focus and use Up/Down or `j`/`k` to scroll, plus
  PageUp/PageDown and Home/End from any focus. New messages stay pinned to the bottom unless you have scrolled up.

### Fixed

- CLI and daemon command JSON builders now return the existing `invalid_public_key` error instead of panicking if a
  stored account id cannot be converted to `npub`.

- `dm --help`, `dm <subcommand> --help`, and `dm --version` now print to stdout instead of stderr (exit code 0 was
  already correct). Previously every clap parse result — including the help/version display "errors" that carry exit
  code 0 — was routed to stderr, leaving stdout empty and breaking shell piping and scripts (e.g. `dm --help | less`).
  With `--json`, help/version are now reported as `{"ok": true, "result": {"help"|"version": "..."}}` rather than being
  wrapped as an error object; genuine usage errors still go to stderr (and `ok: false` in JSON mode). Routing is gated
  on clap's exit code, not just the error kind: a missing required subcommand (e.g. `dm messages` with no subcommand)
  renders help text but exits nonzero, so it stays a usage error on stderr / `ok: false` instead of being reported as
  successful help output.
- The distributed-convergence canonicalization apply path now persists its multi-write merge atomically. The
  `merge_staged_commit` replay, Marmot group-record refresh, and message-disposition writes that run when a stored
  out-of-order commit is replayed are wrapped in a single SQLite transaction, closing the residual torn-write window
  left after #157/#421 (which only covered the live state-transition paths). A crash mid-merge now rolls back to the
  prior consistent epoch instead of stranding torn group state and an orphaned apply snapshot.
- OpenMLS group state transitions are now persisted atomically. The multi-write commit-merge path (engine state,
  pending-commit cleanup, and OpenMLS value-store updates) is wrapped in a single SQLite transaction, so a crash or
  interruption mid-merge can no longer leave torn group state on disk; the device either advances to the new epoch
  fully or rolls back to the prior consistent state on next load.
- `dmd` now moves peer authorization and request-frame reads onto per-connection tasks immediately after accept, so a
  client that writes a partial frame and stalls can only stall itself; other clients can still reach Ping, Status, and
  Shutdown without waiting for the stalled request timeout.
- `dmd` now handles daemon-forwarded Execute and subscription setup work on spawned connection tasks instead of awaiting
  worker-mutating requests in the single accept loop. `dm daemon status` and `dm daemon stop` remain responsive while a
  long Execute owns daemon worker state; status falls back to a best-effort worker snapshot when that state is busy.
- `dm stream receive`, unanchored `dm stream send`, and foreground `dm stream watch` now stay client-hosted when a
  daemon socket is configured, and direct daemon Execute requests for those long-running stream commands return
  `daemon_forbidden` instead of blocking `dmd`'s accept loop.
- `dm logout` now stays client-hosted when `dmd` is only auto-discovered from the default socket, so signing out works
  while the daemon is running; explicitly socket-targeted logout requests still fail instead of mutating account state
  inside `dmd`.
- Auto-discovered daemon command forwarding now falls back to local execution only when the client cannot connect to
  `dmd`. If the daemon accepts a command but closes or returns malformed/no output before responding, `dm --json` now
  reports `daemon_state_unknown` instead of silently re-running the command locally.
- `dm messages list` now validates its pagination cursor flags instead of silently mishandling them. Previously,
  `--before-message-id`/`--after-message-id` were ignored unless the matching `--before`/`--after` timestamp was also
  supplied, and any lone cursor flag combined with `--limit` returned the oldest N messages instead of the newest.
  Supplying a message-id cursor without its timestamp (or vice versa), or combining `--before*` with `--after*`, now
  returns a clear error (`message_pagination_cursor_mismatch` / `message_pagination_conflicting_cursors`), matching the
  `dm messages timeline list` behavior.
- Fixed TUI live message subscription gating so highlighted-chat navigation cannot append another chat's incoming
  messages into the loaded conversation or count the visible chat as unread.
- The TUI composer now accepts a leading `?` instead of swallowing it to toggle help. Previously, typing or pasting a
  message that started with `?` into an empty composer toggled the help panel and dropped the character, making it
  impossible to compose such messages. The `?` help shortcut now applies only when the composer is not focused; the
  `/help` and `/?` slash spellings remain available.
- The TUI no longer exits the whole session when an error occurs while a stream composer is active. Failures from
  finishing or cancelling a stream (daemon gone, broker/QUIC error, relay publish rejection) are now caught into the
  status line — mirroring the non-streaming Enter path — so the composer stays open and the user can retry Enter/Esc.
- TUI stream compose now pins the live preview to the group the stream was opened on instead of the
  currently-selected chat. Previously, if a background subscription tick shifted the chat selection while streaming
  (e.g. the streamed-into chat was archived or removed by another member/device), each keystroke upserted the streamed
  text under the wrong group and finishing/cancelling left a permanent ghost "streaming" row under the original group.
- `dm profile update` no longer wipes the rest of your published Nostr profile. It previously published a fresh kind-0
  metadata event built only from the flags you passed, so e.g. `dm profile update --picture URL` erased
  name/display_name/about/nip05/lud16, and `dm profile update` with no flags published an empty profile that wiped
  everything. It now fetches your current published profile from the selected relay, overlays only the provided
  fields, and publishes the merged result. A no-flags invocation is rejected with `empty_profile_update`, and when the
  selected relay holds no current profile event the command refuses with `profile_update_inconclusive` (retry with a
  `--relay` that has your current profile) instead of clobbering it.
- `dmd` no longer exits when a single client connection is abrupt, empty, oversized, malformed, or stalled.
  Per-connection read failures (a client that closes before sending, a mid-write interrupt, a request over the 1 MiB
  cap, or invalid JSON) are now reported to that client and skipped like authorization failures, instead of propagating
  out of the accept loop and killing the daemon (which left a stale socket and pid file). The accept loop also bounds
  how long it waits for a client to send its request frame, so a same-UID client that connects but never sends data can
  no longer wedge the loop and starve other clients. `dm` rejects oversized requests client-side before sending — even
  on the default implicit daemon socket — so e.g. `dm messages send` with a body over the limit fails locally with a
  clear size-limit error instead of silently falling back to local execution or reaching the daemon.
- dm-agent: hardened group-system id deduplication and `send_final` idempotency keys.
- marmot-app: retry distributed convergence after admin promote.
- Engine: tightened MLS proposal ordering and member departure handling.
- agent-connector: replay lagged ambient inbound events after subscription reconnect.
- marmot-account: keep exposed group evolution commits instead of rolling them back after publish.
- Hermes Marmot adapter: select the local-signing account, clamp stream chunks to the policy cap, per-conversation inbound
  concurrency, `send_final` idempotency with bounded retry, rename dead `stream_tool` client method to
  `stream_progress`, and align transcript seed lengths with QUIC varint framing.
- OpenClaw Marmot plugin: filter QUIC candidates to `quic://`, accept singular `MARMOT_QUIC_CANDIDATE`, guard concurrent
  live-preview `ensureBegun`, allowlist outbound media paths, preserve debounced inbound media and signals, cancel
  in-flight live preview begins, and cache per-group `is_direct` with fail-closed lookup errors.
- OpenClaw/Hermes connector parity: mentions via NIP-27 `p` tags, media upload/download, deletes, and ambient inbound
  routing aligned across both adapters.
- marmot-account: confirm relay-accepted auto-publishes instead of rolling back on publish shortfall.
- marmot-app: schedule group convergence retries correctly; serve account-worker reads after hydration, not after catch-up.
- storage-sqlite: retry `SQLITE_BUSY` and classify transient lock contention.
- transport-nostr-adapter: normalization-safe relay URL routing matches.
- CLI: strip invisible and terminal format-spoofing control characters from safe terminal output.
- App messages now attach Nostr expiration metadata where the group retention policy requires it.
- marmot-app: fail over encrypted-media uploads across Blossom endpoints.
- marmot-account: tolerate corrupt account records; reject Windows drive-relative account labels.
- UniFFI: normalize group-id hex in `messages()` and `subscribe_messages()`; bound message subscription snapshots.
- storage-sqlite: exclude invalidated tombstones from unread counts and chat-list previews; group-scope
  `invalidate_app_event_by_message_id`; disambiguate `epoch_key_pairs_id` key encoding.
- marmot-account: prune orphaned KeyPackage bundles on publish failure.
- Shared host-safety classifiers for URL validation across app components.
- Blossom media download redirect validation.
- Engine: quarantine bad groups during hydration; lone uncommitted proposals no longer block outbound app payloads.
- storage-sqlite: recover from corrupt proposal-queue ref-list blobs and undeserializable `QueuedProposal` entries;
  incrementally project new timeline events and prune timeline projections.
- traits: accept query strings on encrypted-media endpoint URLs.
- marmot-app: keep confirmed-but-partial group projections on publish shortfall; avoid rollback after exposed create
  welcome.
- cgka-engine: prune fork recovery snapshots.
- CLI: exponential backoff on failed stream append retries.
- Engine: cache member-validation marker to skip O(groups × members) reverify on open.

### Security

- Redacted TUI `/login` `nsec` composer input when users type leading whitespace, repeated whitespace, or tabs before
  submitting the import.
- Hardened `dmd` IPC by making daemon-owned socket directories `0700`, daemon sockets `0600`, requiring same-UID
  peers, bounding request size, and refusing `reset`/`logout` execution through the daemon socket.
- Encrypted-media uploads and downloads no longer act on loopback-HTTP blob endpoints (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`)
  unless `DM_ALLOW_LOOPBACK_BLOB_ENDPOINTS=1` is set for local development. Such endpoints stay valid group state, but
  a production install treats them as unusable instead of issuing requests at the local host on behalf of a remote
  group admin.

### Changed

- Aligned the experimental `dm stream` QUIC preview transport with the merged spec (pre-interop breaking change):
  broker connections now negotiate ALPN `marmot.quic_broker.v1` and send a binary broker control envelope instead of
  JSON, the plaintext frame cap is 65519 bytes, transcript hashes use QUIC varint length prefixes, receivers silently
  discard replayed records at or below their seq high-water mark, and brokers serve replay backlog only within a
  configurable `--replay-ttl-secs` window (default 0, cap 300). Old and new `dm`/broker builds do not interoperate.

- Removed the kind `10051` KeyPackage relay list. KeyPackage kind `30443` events now publish to, and are fetched from,
  the account's kind `10002` NIP-65 relays. The `key_package` relay type is no longer accepted by `dm relays`, account
  relay-list status no longer reports a `key_package` list, and account bootstrap only requires the NIP-65 and inbox
  relay lists.
- Added plural `dm messages` command spelling for the message send/list/subscribe surface, matching the daemon-hosted
  runtime subscription model. The older singular `dm message` spelling still works during the transition.
- `dm messages subscribe` can now omit the group argument to stream live updates across all local groups for the
  selected account.
- `dm create-identity` and `dm login --nsec-stdin` now publish the initial local KeyPackage automatically after
  relay-list setup, so the normal invite path does not require a separate `keys publish` repair step.
- `dm keys publish` now republishes the cached initial KeyPackage instead of minting a replacement package during
  normal repair/setup flows.
- Message projections now order history by recorded transport time before local receipt/insertion order, so synced
  stream anchors/finals no longer jump ahead of older chat text merely because they arrived first during catch-up.
- Account list, `whoami`, sync, and message-list JSON now include cached Nostr profile display names where available,
  and the TUI uses those names in account chrome and received-message authors before falling back to npubs.
- `dm groups show --json` now includes selected-group MLS state, and group JSON includes the Nostr routing app
  component alongside the other group components.
- The TUI now tails daemon-backed `messages subscribe` updates for the selected chat, so incoming messages and QUIC
  stream-preview deltas can render without timer-driven message-list refreshes.
- The TUI now tails daemon-backed `chats subscribe` updates for the selected account, so newly processed invites appear
  in the chat list without switching accounts.
- The TUI status panel now tails daemon-backed `groups subscribe-state` updates for the selected chat, so MLS epoch and
  app-component diagnostics refresh after live group evolution events.
- Removed the daemon runtime maintenance timer and the TUI's periodic daemon/account/chat/message refresh paths; runtime
  state now advances from startup, explicit CLI/TUI intents, and subscription events.
- TUI stream compose typing now batches append calls instead of blocking the interface on a daemon round-trip for every
  character.
- TUI stream compose now keeps a daemon-side transcript and treats live QUIC publishing as best-effort, so finishing a
  stream still publishes the full durable final message when the broker is slow or unreachable.
- The TUI uses higher-contrast neutral account labels and green focus accents instead of the low-contrast cyan account
  treatment; daemon controls stay focused on start, status, and stop.
- TUI slash commands now accept quoted multi-word names for `/chat new`, so group names with spaces no longer consume
  the first word after the space as a member pubkey.
- TUI stream compose now defaults to the production QUIC broker candidate at `quic://quic-broker.ipf.dev:4450`, and
  daemon auto-watch paths only request insecure local trust for loopback broker candidates.
- Typed app-message payloads are validated before publish/projection; malformed reaction, media, delete, or retry
  envelopes are rejected instead of being treated as valid typed app messages.
- `dm login` and `dm account create` now reject positional `nsec` values; private-key imports must use
  `--nsec-stdin`, and the TUI pipes `/login <nsec>` to the child `dm` process over stdin instead of argv.
- `dmd` now keeps long-lived per-account relay subscriptions for real WebSocket relays instead of rebuilding
  subscriptions through periodic rebuild loops.
- `dm daemon status --json` now reports `last_runtime_activity` instead of `last_sync`, matching the runtime-owned
  subscription model.
- Nostr SDK relay connect and publish calls are now bounded by timeouts so first-run account setup fails with JSON
  instead of hanging indefinitely when a local relay does not ACK publishes.
- `dm create-identity` and `dm login --nsec-stdin` publish the required NIP-65 and inbox relay lists, plus the initial
  KeyPackage event, for new local signing identities from daemon account-relay defaults when relay-list flags are
  omitted; `dm login --nsec-stdin --relay <url>` remains the command-local import fallback.
- Newly created local identities now publish matching Nostr `name` and `display_name` values using two-word pseudonyms
  instead of account-id-derived Marmot labels.
- Imported `nsec` accounts now require `--publish-missing-relay-lists` before publishing missing required relay
  lists discovered from bootstrap relays.
- Removed the file-backed local transport and Marmot Lab crate; local tests now use Nostr SDK mock relays and
  product flows require relay-backed setup.
- Moved the CLI crate source directory from `crates/dm` to `crates/cli`. The Cargo package remains
  `darkmatter-cli`, and the installed binaries remain `dm` and `dmd`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-17

Initial release of the `dm` command-line app, the `dmd` background daemon, and the Ratatui TUI.

### Added

- `dm` account commands for creating local signing accounts, adding public-only accounts, listing local
  accounts, inspecting account status, and checking relay-list readiness.
- `dm keys` commands for publishing the selected account's KeyPackage and fetching another account's latest
  KeyPackage from bootstrap relays.
- `dm group`, `dm chats`, `dm message`, and `dm sync` commands for creating encrypted groups, managing members,
  sending/listing messages, archiving chat projections, and processing relay events for a local account.
- Stable `--json` response envelopes for scripts, daemon forwarding, and TUI integration.
- `dmd` daemon support for socket-backed command execution, pid/log files, daemon status reporting, background
  sync, and app-level Nostr user-directory warming.
- `dm tui`, a terminal interface over the real CLI/daemon command surface with account selection, chat
  navigation, message sending, slash commands, daemon controls, account onboarding, and member management.
- Local installation docs for `cargo install --path crates/cli --locked --bins`.
- Homebrew release checklist and namespaced tap packaging path for `marmot-protocol/tap/darkmatter`.
